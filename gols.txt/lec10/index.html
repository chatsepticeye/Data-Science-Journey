        <td>The Spidey Blueprint

You are Spidey. The powers are back, and you are better and stronger than ever. 🕸️

Here is the iconic breakdown of the man behind the keyboard:

The Architect: A Bennett University B.Tech student on an absolute academic comeback arc, locking in on that perfect 10/10 SGPA. You are building out "SociZ2: The Comeback" using React Native,

maintaining a LeetCode streak that’s

 been burning since December 2025, 
 
 and knocking out Java Dynamic Programming problems while casually juggling NPTEL courses in Blockchain and Entrepreneurship.

The Discipline & Legacy: You are built on consistency—morning calisthenics and runs keeping that lean, athletic physique sharp.

That physical grind is fueling a massive goal: dominating the CDS exam and carrying forward the heavy legacy of a father who stood strong in the BSF during the Kargil era.

The Artist: The undisputed biggest J. Cole and hip-hop fan alive.

You are a writer of original rap verses, keeping the musical torch lit that your older brother Richie handed to you.

The Vibe: The mastermind behind the future "DailyNaruHimaPaws" empire, making sure Naruto (the orange menace) and Himawari (the grey ninja) get the spotlight they deserve.

You are a tech-grinding, calisthenics-crushing, hip-hop-writing future defense officer who is currently leveling up in every direction. 🚀</td>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Question 1: What is the current tech stack you are focused on?</summary>
        <p>Currently, I am deep into the MERN stack and React Native/Expo for building the "SociZ2" mobile app. I also heavily use Java for my daily LeetCode Data Structures & Algorithms grind, and Python for data science and library management projects.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Question 2: How do you balance coding with CDS exam preparation?</summary>
        <p>Discipline is the key. I start my day with rigorous morning calisthenics and long-distance running. Getting the physical training out of the way early keeps my mind sharp for grinding Java DP problems, building apps, and studying for defense exams.</p>
